# NLP-Text-Predictor

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. SwiftKey, our corporate partner in this capstone, builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models. When someone types:

*I went to the*

the keyboard presents three options for what the next word might be. For example, the three words might be gym, store, restaurant. In this capstone you will work on understanding and building predictive text models like those used by SwiftKey.
The data is from a corpus called [HC Corpora](www.corpora.heliohost.org). See the readme file at http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/aboutcorpus.html for details on the corpora available. The files have been language filtered but may still contain some foreign text.

In this capstone we will be applying data science in the area of natural language processing. As a first step toward working on this project, you should familiarize yourself with Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, and the associated tools in R. Here are some resources that may be helpful to you.

## Dataset

This is the training data to get you started that will be the basis for most of the capstone. You must download the data from the Coursera site and not from external websites to start.
